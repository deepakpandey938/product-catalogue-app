# Getting Started with Vite (React)

This project was bootstrapped with Vite
 — a fast frontend build tool optimized for modern web development.

 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## npm run dev

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173
 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload instantly when you make changes.
You may also see build warnings or errors in the terminal.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the dist folder.
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the output for best performance.

Minified build

Optimized asset chunks

Ready for deployment to Vercel / Render / Netlify

See more details in the Vite deployment guide.

### `npm run preview`


Serves the production build locally.
Useful for verifying:

Build correctness

Routing

Layout responsiveness

Asset paths

This simulates how the final deployed version will run.
## `No eject command`

Unlike Create React App, Vite does not include an eject script because:

All configurations are already accessible

No hidden build system

Modify anything using vite.config.js

You maintain full control without needing to eject.
